This project involves writing a <a href = "https://github.com/ElleNaazB/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeSQL.sql">query</a> that effectively gathers detailed information on employees within an organizational <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/data">information</a>. It lists essential details like employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for all employees, providing a complete overview. The query also identifies employees hired in 1986 by their names and hire dates, offering insights into hiring trends.

Furthermore, it outlines the organizational structure by listing department managers along with their department number, name, and key employee details, mapping out the hierarchy. It connects each employee to their respective department, showing their department number, employee details, and department name for a clear view of the organizational layout.

For specific queries, it finds employees named Hercules with a last name starting with B, focusing on unique names. It also highlights employees in the Sales department and those in both Sales and Development departments, showing their department affiliations.

Lastly, it analyzes last name frequencies among employees, ranking them in descending order to reveal common last names, simplifying the comprehensive analysis into key insights about the workforce.
